Project for CS304 - Databases and Web Interfaces

Ashley Thomas and Sasha Levy

We made this project for our CS class. We have created a media website, where people can make an account, add friends and see their top media, and edit media and rate it. We wanted this to be an interactive website where people can learn about new exciting media based on their friends' interests.
